# Kubernetes Best Practices in Rego Policy
This project demonstrates the implementation of best practices for Kubernetes using Rego policies. The policies are designed to help users follow recommended guidelines for deploying applications on Kubernetes clusters and ensuring the infrastructure's security, reliability, and scalability.

The Rego policy files in this repository cover various aspects of Kubernetes deployments, such as:

Ensuring deployments use the default namespace
Managing host aliases for deployments
Implementing liveness and readiness probes for deployed applications
Restricting the use of host ports in deployments
Setting resource requests for CPU and memory
By following these best practices and applying the Rego policies provided in this repository, you can enhance your Kubernetes deployments and create a more robust and efficient infrastructure.
